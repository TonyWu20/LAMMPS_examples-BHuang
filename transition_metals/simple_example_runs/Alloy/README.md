# Alloy simulations in LAMMPS

## Requirements

1. Find existing potential files of alloy systems on the internet.
2. Build a series of alloy mixture by varing the alloy proportions and crystal
   phases if possible.
3. Relax the structure.

Extra:

- Experiment the difference between `fix npt` and `fix box/relax`
